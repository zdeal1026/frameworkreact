## Description

This is a updated portfolio using a react application. I started to rebuild this application because I didn't reallly like it but I ran short on time. I look forward to coming back and finishing this correctly with a navbar that links to the project. It's kind of hard because all of my attention is on project 3 at this point and it's hard to focus on it. I have already deployed this to github pages so I left what I had and didnt redeploy what I have now because the application is broken. 

## Installation

To create run this application, you will need to create a react app (npx create-react-app). Once you have the app created you will need to install (npm install) the dependencies used.

## Usage

This application is a portfolio page for my resume.

## License

MIT license used.

## Contributing
